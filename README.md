## Deploy to a subdirectory with a Path PrefixJump to heading
If your site lives in a different subdirectory (particularly useful with GitHub pages), use pathPrefix to specify this. When paired with the HTML <base> plugin it will transform any absolute URLs in your HTML to include this folder name and does not affect where things go in the output folder.
Path Prefix
Command Line Override --pathprefix
